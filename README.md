## financial-analysis-report
**make a comprehensive financial analysis report on the attached data. Include interactive charts and/or graphs. Make it visually appealing. Use advanced algorithms to suggest price forecasts, providing rationale and confidence intervals. Put everything in a standalone html file.**

## builder-like-Figma
**Develop a drag-and-drop UI builder like Figma. Include snap-to-grid and alignment guides. Include many advanced settings. Include an export option to HTML.**

# three-body-problem
**Create a p5.js simulation of a multi-body gravitational system centered on the Sun, Earth, and Jupiter, using realistic Newtonian gravity and ensuring all three bodies stay within the canvas while moving smoothly. Use a background value of 220, apply noStroke(), and render persistent orbital trails to clearly visualize the motion of each object over time. Add a spacecraft that starts on Earth, then departs to complete a clear loop around the Sun, and finally travels on a physically plausible trajectory to reach Jupiter. Configure the initial positions, velocities, and masses so that the planetary orbits are chaotic and non-stable (not like the real solar system), yet still remain bounded and visually coherent. The final simulation should behave as an interactive, visually engaging, physics-consistent environment where all bodies and the spacecraft move dynamically, without drifting off to infinity or collapsing into unnatural clusters. Put everything in a standalone html file.**

# simulation-of-galaxy
**Create a p5.js simulation of galaxy formation where all entities are rendered as simple circles with varying sizes and brightness, using a large number of particles (for example up to tens or hundreds of thousands) that gradually self-organize into a physically plausible galaxy. The background should use a base color of 220 and stay visually subtle so the particle dynamics are clearly visible. Use p5.Vector for all motion and forces, with simplified gravitational interaction between particles (e.g. mass points) plus optional merging and basic mass conservation, and use a Quadtree (or similar spatial partitioning) to keep the simulation performant. A collapsing protogalactic cloud should evolve into a roughly spiral-like galaxy, with particles representing stars orbiting a central region in a Keplerian-like way (inner orbits faster than outer ones), influenced by an invisible dark matter halo and a central massive core or black hole. The simulation should run smoothly on a typical desktop machine and remain visually engaging, with clear motion and overall structure showing the emergence and evolution of the galaxy over time.
